Hello Eveyone and thank you for checking out The Strainerator!

To run this app head over to the seperate backend repo.

Make sure Rack-CORS gem and the cors.rb initializer is uncommented and origins is switched to * 

Bundle Install

Run rails db:migrate and rails db:seed and fire up that server like you are fireing up a fatty after a long hard week of work. With rails s.

Flip back over here and simply run lite-server to get The Strainerator to pop up in your browser!

The Strainerator is a light hearted and fun weed strain name generator.

The index page features a enter button that alerts the user that they sould be 21 years of age or have their medical card to enter the app for legal purposes.

Upon entry to the app you are hit with the main page that consists of three buttons. The Green Generate Button, the clear button, and the add to the database button.

The Generate button will fire the randomizer and select a random entry from three categories. The starter, the flavor and the Finale. 

Be sure to hit the clear button after each press of the generate button
This is a bug we will be fixing and in the near future will soon have no need for the clear button and will not need to refresh the page. Thank you for your understanding.

Lastly we have an add to the database button, this button links to the DB page where the user can add their own contributions to the database and therefore the randomizer. It is sugguested to add youself or your friends name, your favorite flavor, just as long as it is clever. 

On the same page is a link to the full list of database entries where users can see all of the options the randomizer has to try and not add repeated words. 

After adding to the database play with the Generate button some more and see your entry added!
